# Vision Transformer

[Vision Transformer](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YicbFdNTTy) (ICLR 2021 submission) in PyTorch.

The vision transformer is a promising new direction for vision tasks. It manages to get rid of convolutions, using only the transformer architecture from [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) as building block. 

[Yannic Kilcher's explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrdevFK_am4) is pretty solid; watch it!
